# Workflow

The intelligent generative design of structural connection components primarily employs techniques such as topology optimization, deep learning, and surface reconstruction and materialization. This process involves three essential steps: the establishment of deep learning datasets, the construction of deep neural networks, and the surface reconstruction and solidification of the generated 3D data.
